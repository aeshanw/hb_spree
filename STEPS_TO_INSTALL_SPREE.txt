Steps:

new project: 
rails new storename -d mysql

edit gemfile:
gem 'spree','0.70.3'

in terminal:
bundle install
rake db:create
rails g spree:site
rake db:migrate
rake db:seed
rake spree_sample:load
rake db:admin:create

At this point, there is a spree store setup with samples but no gems
To improve development performance:
bundle exec rake assets:precompile:nondigest

Railâ€™s also provides the following rake task that will delete the entire public/assets directory, this can be helpful to clear out development assets before committing: 
rake assets:clean

In Gemfile:
gem 'spree_store_credits', :git => 'git://github.com/spree/spree_store_credits.git'

In terminal:
bundle install
rails g spree_store_credits:install -f
rake db:migrate

We now have a working environment with store credits installed
